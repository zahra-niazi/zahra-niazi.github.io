Hey there!
Welcome to this Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) tutorial!

During my graduate course on neural networks and deep learning at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, under the guidance of Dr. Rouhani, I was tasked with making a presentation about deep reinforcement learning. It was a fascinating challenge to connect what we learned in class with the real-world applications of deep learning in reinforcement scenarios.
