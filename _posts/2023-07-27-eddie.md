This is a report on the exciting exploration of 2D and Visual SLAM and navigation with Eddie, a versatile differential drive robot.






In this report, we delve into a detailed analysis of Eddie's hardware and software components, including its firmware command set. We also discuss the challenges we encountered while setting up Eddie's Kinect sensor and the step-by-step process of bringing Eddie to life and teleoperating it from a static laptop.








You can see our attempt at teleoperating Eddie [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtZwPk3DaKk).

Then, we unravel Eddie's kinematic model and delve into the mathematical intricacies involved in obtaining the odometry for our differential drive robot. We present a thorough analysis of the formulas and calculations used to precisely track Eddie's movements.

Next, we deep dive into 2D SLAM and ROS2 navigation techniques, testing the methods to create a map of Eddie's environment and exploring how Eddie successfully navigates through it.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvVIIlhwI-I) is our attempt at testing slam_toolbox alongside nav2.

Lastly, we explore various visual SLAM libraries. Ultimately we decide on RTABMap, and we evaluate its performance with Eddie.
